### To Do
- Inside project
- [ ] create dir Structure

- Outside src
- [ ] create a README.md (contract)
- [ ] create a TODO.md (steps to be taken care of)

- Inside test
- [ ] create a testFile for contract, contain topLevel function to test
- [ ] pass the minimal test without files (use data internally)
- [ ] extract the tested fn into a file
- [ ] gitHub all the entries and start syncing with remote (git push)
- [ ] use editor to commit, push and rename files

- Inside src
- [ ] extract the tested fn into a file
- [ ] start `mocha` watcher (mocha -w)
- [ ] Implement individual fns and chain them in the main fn
- [ ] use editor to create new files and require
- [ ] Re look at the ToDo multiple times
- [ ] Re look at the README to decide while writing TODO
- [ ] pick on the feature or part you want to build, follow the todo process 
- [ ] note down the improvements/ideas you get while writing code ( don't add )
- [ ] discard ideas if they are not necessary

- Note
- [ ] Test functions that are being used from outside by Mocking
- [ ] Check the call Count of fns provided if needed
- [ ] Don't add improvements to code unless needed (code upon need)
- [ ] Do not get off track the process that was started
